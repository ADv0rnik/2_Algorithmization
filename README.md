**Exercise01.** Find the sum of elements in the array A[N] that are multiples of a given K.

**Exercise02.** Replace all elements of the array greater than the given Z with this value. Show number of replacements.

**Exercise03.** Count number of positive, negative and zero elements in the array.

**Exercise04.** Swap the largest and smallest elements in the array.

**Exercise05.** Print only those numbers for which ai> i.

**Exercise06.** Calculate the sum of numbers whose ordinal numbers are prime numbers.

**Exercise07.** Define max(a1 + a_2n, a2 + a_2n-1, ..., a_n + a_n+1) for an array of real numbers

**Exercise08.** Given a sequence of integers a1,a2,...,a_n. Create a new sequence by removing from the original those elements that are correspond to min(a1,a2, ,an).

**Exercise09.** In an array of integers with length n find the most common number. If there are more than one of these numbers, define the smallest one.

**Exercise10.** Compress the array, discarding every second element from it (fill the vacated elements with zeros).

**Exercise11.** A matrix is given. Display all odd columns with the first item greater than the last.

**Exercise12.** A square matrix is given. Display all elements on a diagonal
